I'm sorry, my English isn't very good.
These are merely some copied files of the Simplified Chinese version.
Due to my busy schedule with personal errands recently, I haven't added detailed English comments in the code yet
And these files don't contain all the content. I have chosen and organized some parts that I believe you are more likely to accept.
I will supplement the remaining parts shortly.
【Additional content】
【1】Review of the conversation content
Players can check the corresponding dialogue option branches in the "Consciousness" book after completing certain main and side quests, covering all options that may affect the subsequent plot.
However, I only organized the Chinese dialogues. There is just too much content.
【2】Blacksmith and black market experience
Players can view the current black market experience progress after completing transactions with the black market.
Players can check the current blacksmith experience progress when talking with the blacksmith.
【3】Extra effects of the Kinuil 
It can deal random damage to nearby enemies. Of course, it's not truly random. I just divided it into 11 different damages and randomly selected among them.
【4】Rune Recycling spell.
It can transform the runes on the ground into runes and experience of the corresponding level.
【5】High-quality equipment refresh notification in the shop.
When players use the forced refresh near the blacksmith/potion merchant/arrow merchant, and if high-quality equipment appears, players will receive an audio cue.
【6】View tips content.
Players can view the tips content in the "Consciousness" book. The method of refreshing a tip every once in a while is great, but inevitably, many contents appear very rarely or even not at all. Therefore, I have added an option in the "Consciousness" book to allow players to view the tips content. Due to the sheer volume of content, I have only performed a simple categorization and created it in Chinese only. If you are interested, you can organize it using your own approach.
